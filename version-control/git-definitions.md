# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? It keeps track of changes made in the code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? It keeps work in a separate branch so the master branch is safe.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? Commit is when you save the snapshot of the staged file. A good commit message explains the what and why things were changed instead of how.
* What is a merge conflict? When two changes affect the same area of code.
